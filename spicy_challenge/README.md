## Spicy Challenge

**NOTE** 
If you've come here before having completed the exercises in the `practice` directory, go back and do those first!


1. Utilizing the given `Patronable` module, write functionality that will get each test within `spicy_spec` to pass.
2. Notice that we're testing the `Patronable` module directly (`RSpec.describe Patronable do`), but calling the methods to each of our respective `Inn` and `Saloon` objects. You should be writing your methods directly on the `Patronable` module.
3. When you've successfully passed all the tests, take a look at the `Patronable` module. Is your code DRY? Are there any repeated lines/functionality? If so, refactor your code, then `commit` your work and submit a `pull request` against the main repo! Check back in a day or two to see what your classmates' solutions were!
